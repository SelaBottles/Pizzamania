			<h3> Pizza is Awesome! </h3>

			<p> Pizza is a savory dish of Italian origin, consisting of a usually round, flattened base of leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomatoes, cheese, and often various other ingredients baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven. A small pizza is sometimes called a pizzetta. </p>

			<p> Just hearing the word "pizza" brings a smile to the face of just about every person who's ever tasted it. Whatever style or variety -- from thick,  deep-dish pizza stuffed with gobs of cheese, sausage, and pepperoni to a thin-as-a-cracker crust topped with veggies -- pizza invariably makes it to the top of "favorite food" lists. I know for sure that its on mine. </p>

			<p> The further back we look in time, the more interesting details we can find about that surrounds pizza. Today this dish is one of the most popular foods on the entire Earth, but that fame and recognition came from the decades of work of many international pizza restaurant franchises which spread this dish to the all four corners of the world. </p>

			<p> Before these pizza chains were formed, this dish slowly rose in popularity in the United Stated, brought from the Europe by the Italian settlers which did not wanted to be parted from one of the most iconic meals of their country. And there, in the Mediterranean coastal city of Naples, the modern Pizza was created. </p>

			<p> Although the way pizza rose from the local low-class meal in the poor districts of Naples to the state it has today is interesting and filled with important moments, the current worldwide popularity of this incredible dish has created many interesting facts around it. And if you have the time to spare, you can find about them all. </p>

			<p> Today, pizza is not just a meal, it's become a tradition, a way of life, a cause to celebrate, a unifier, an embodiment of passions. Bringing families, friends, all and sundry a sizzling slice of melting goo at a time.  </p>
